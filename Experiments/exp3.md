Okay, the user asked "4+10是多少？" which means "What is 4+10?" in Chinese. I need to provide the correct answer.

First, I check the tools available. There's an "add" function that takes two numbers, a and b. The user's question is a simple addition problem, so using the add function is the right choice.

I call the add function with a=4 and b=10. The response from the tool is 14.0. That makes sense because 4 plus 10 equals 14. 

Now, I should present the answer clearly. Since the user used Chinese, I'll respond in Chinese as well. The answer is straightforward, so I'll just state the result. No need for extra explanations here. 

Double-checking to make sure there are no mistakes. The calculation is correct, and the function used is appropriate. Alright, time to send the response.

4 + 10 的結果是 14。

Okay, the user asked for the sum of 3, 10, and 66. I used the add3 function to calculate it. The function returned 79.0. Since the user probably expects a straightforward answer, I should present the result clearly. Let me check if there's any need for further steps, but it seems like a simple addition. The answer is 79, so I'll state that directly.

3 + 10 + 66 的結果是 **79**。
