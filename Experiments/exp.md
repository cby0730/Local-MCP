Okay, let's see. The user asked to solve (3 + 5) x 12 / (5 + (-1)). I need to break this down step by step using the functions provided.

First, I'll handle the addition in the numerator: 3 + 5. Using the add function, that gives 8. Then, multiply that result by 12 using the multiply function, which gives 96. 

Next, the denominator: 5 + (-1). Again, using the add function, this equals 4. Now, divide the numerator result by the denominator using the divide function. 96 divided by 4 is 24. 

Each step's result was confirmed with the respective tool calls. The final answer after all operations is 24.0. So, the solution is 24.
</think>

The result of the calculation $(3 + 5) \times 12 \div (5 + (-1))$ is **24**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Addition in numerator:** $3 + 5 = 8$
2. **Multiplication:** $8 \times 12 = 96$
3. **Addition in denominator:** $5 + (-1) = 4$
4. **Division:** $96 \div 4 = 24$

Final Answer: $\boxed{24}$

您: 那(3 + 5) x 12是多少?

Okay, the user is asking, "(3 + 5) x 12是多少?" which translates to "What is (3 + 5) multiplied by 12?" Let me break this down.

First, I need to calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 3 + 5. That's straightforward addition. 3 plus 5 equals 8. 

Next, the problem requires multiplying the result by 12. So, 8 times 12. Let me verify that multiplication. 8 times 10 is 80, and 8 times 2 is 16. Adding those together, 80 + 16 equals 96. 

Wait, the user might be testing if I can handle basic arithmetic operations correctly. Let me double-check. Yes, 3+5 is definitely 8, and 8*12 is 96. There's no ambiguity here. 

Looking back at the previous interaction, the user asked a similar question but with division involved. Now they're focusing on just the multiplication part. They might be practicing arithmetic step by step. 

I should present the answer clearly, showing each step so the user can follow along. Also, since they've used LaTeX formatting before, maybe they expect a similar format here. 

No functions need to be called here because it's a simple calculation. The answer is 96. Let me make sure I don't mix up any steps. Yep, all correct. 

Final answer should be boxed as per their previous example. Alright, ready to respond.
</think>

(3 + 5) × 12 的計算步驟如下：

1. **加法運算**：3 + 5 = 8  
2. **乘法運算**：8 × 12 = 96  

最終結果為：$\boxed{96}$

Okay, the user is asking about the result of the first question. Let me check the history.

In the first query, the user asked for (3 + 5) x 12 / (5 + (-1)). I calculated that as 24. Then they asked a follow-up about (3 + 5) x 12, which is 96. Now they're asking "第一題的結果是多少?" which translates to "What is the result of the first question?" 

So they're referring back to the original problem. The first question's answer was 24. I need to confirm that and present it clearly. Maybe they want just the answer without the steps again. Let me make sure to state it directly.
</think>

第一題的結果是 $\boxed{24}$。
